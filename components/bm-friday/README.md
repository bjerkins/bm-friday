# \<bm-friday\>

> Is it Friday yet ?

A custom web component that will tell you whether or not it is Friday.

Check out the [demo](https://bjerkins.github.io/bm-friday/components/bm-friday/demo/)
and [API docs](https://bjerkins.github.io/bm-friday/components/bm-friday)

## Developing

### Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

### Serving

```
$ polymer serve
```

### Building it

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
$ polymer serve build/bundled
```

### Running Tests

```
$ polymer serve
```

and navigate to `test/`
